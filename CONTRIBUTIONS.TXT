- Researched common methods of malware distribution as well as ways of circumventing antivirus detection. 
- Created the phishing email and document that are sent to a target, as well as the visual basic macro that downloads and automatically runs the hosted executable. 
- Obfuscated the visual basic macro contained in the document to avoid detection by a majority of tested antivirsuses. 
- Researched and developed a proof of concept for decrypting the user's files by injecting code into the Game Theory process using Pyrasite.
- Created a distributable Virtual Machine image with the target version of Windows and Microsoft Office installed for use in testing, and helped test the malware as it was developed
- Worked alongside the other members of the team to write and develop the report and readme

Aidan Rubenstein:
- Created and contributed to the project report in all major sections.
- Researched the ethical limitations of the project according to the ACM Code of Ethics.
- Analyzed the malware in its working state on a test machine to look at possible workarounds for an anti-malware solution.

- Organized team discussions and project deliverables as it pertained to phase submissions and code implementation
